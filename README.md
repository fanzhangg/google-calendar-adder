# Google Calendar Events Adder
Extract event information from the table on the web page, and add the event to the Google Calendar

# How-to
- Ensure the table includes the event's date and summary
- Input the web page's url
- Input the table's head\
    \* Your table is next to the head element by default. (FYI: [Academic Calendars](https://www.macalester.edu/registrar/academiccalendars/) The first column is the date and the last column is the summary
     by default. If the target table has a format different from this one, please change the script manually
- run the problem
- WITNESS THE MIRACLE!
